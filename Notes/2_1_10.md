The process of interaction design

### Three Key Characteristics

 * Focus on users early in the design and eval of the artifact
 * Identify, document, and agree on *SPECIFIC* usability and user experience goals
 * Iterate. No one gets it right the first time. 

### Identify the users and the stakeholders

 * Stakeholders: Managers, those who use the output 
 * primary users: use product on regular basis
 * secondary users: occasionally or via someone else
 * tertiary users: affected by introduction
