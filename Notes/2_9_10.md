# Chapter 8

Designing and Prototyping

## Class Notes

 * Show how all of the systems go together
 * color scheme
 * some sort of presentation for thursday
 * story board needs to be visible from 5 feet away.

## Overview

 * protyping and constructing
 * conceptual design
 * physical design
   * design of physical product
   * implementation of software, how the user interacts, etc.

## Protyping and Constructing

 * diff kinds 
   * low fidelity
      * non-interactive
      * paper based
      * foam models
      * design tool (OmniGraffle, etc.)
   * high fidelity
 * compromises in prototyping
   * vertical ("deep")
   * horizantal ("shallow")
 * Construction
   * we prototype one way, probably will be rewritten by others.

### What is a prototype

 * small car or building
 * interaction design
   * video
   * storyboard 
   * slide show
   * limited functionality software
   * mockup (cardboard, wood)

### Why prototype

 * promotes communication between team members
 * validation of design ideas
 * encourages reflection, eval, and feedback 

### Low Fidelity Prototype
 
 * simple medium
 * flexible
 * throw away 
 * post-it notes
 * storyboards
 * Wizard Of Oz - The man behind the curtain. The user thinks something is happening but it's all fake :p

### High Fidelity Prototype

 * materials close to final product
 * common dev environment
 * looks, but does not act, like final product
 * could turn into mislet users who think product is usable

### Construction
 
 * engineering vs design (see slides)
 
##  Conceptual Design

 * a set of integrated ideas and concepts that shows what the system will do and describe how it should look. Also cover how it will work.

##  Physical Design

 * ... we skipped this?
